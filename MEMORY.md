# MEMORY.md

> Running record of project state, locked decisions, and watch-outs. Companion to [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) / [PRD.md](./PRD.md) / [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) / [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) — but **more living**. Update as state changes.

## Current state (2026-05)

- **Branch:** `main`. Local is **4 commits ahead of `origin/main`** — not yet pushed.
- **Latest commits (newest first):**
  - `d48c5ed` Complete M0 scaffold: backend (Django + Celery + DO Procfile) + iOS (xcodegen + SwiftUI) + CI
  - `dd2a003` Scaffold M0 phase 2a — web surface (frontend-web + three suite placeholders)
  - `0090063` Add CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md for durable repo-level context
  - `5375384` Scaffold Offside CRM monorepo with planning docs and shared packages
- **Milestone status:**
  - **M0 — complete.** Repo skeleton resolves end-to-end: `pnpm install` resolves all workspaces, `pnpm dev` runs all four web apps (3000/3001/3002/3003), `pnpm backend:up` boots Django + Postgres + Redis + Celery worker + Beat via docker-compose, `pnpm ios:gen` generates a buildable Xcode project, GitHub Actions CI runs on push + PR.
  - **M1 — pending (next).** Backend foundation: allauth + dj-rest-auth + SimpleJWT custom user, drf-spectacular emitting OpenAPI, Celery `ping` smoke task confirmed end-to-end, OpenAPI codegen wired into `pnpm codegen:openapi`.
  - **M2–M15 — pending.** Per [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). Estimated total 83 working days ≈ 5.5–7.5 months calendar.

## Locked decisions (interview Rounds 1–7)

Captured exhaustively in PLAN.md §5.1 and §14.0. The non-obvious ones:

- **Drizzle and tRPC dropped.** Hybrid Next.js + Django stack means OpenAPI codegen is the type chain.
- **Auth = django-allauth + dj-rest-auth + SimpleJWT** (NOT Djoser, despite SaucyCart using Djoser).
- **API framework = DRF** (NOT Django Ninja, despite SaucyCart using Ninja). drf-spectacular for OpenAPI.
- **Workflow engine = Celery + Redis + custom Django durable layer** (NOT Inngest — DO App Platform constraint). See PLAN.md §7.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (web) + Digital Ocean App Platform (Django web/worker/beat) + DO Managed Postgres + DO Managed Redis.
- **Monorepo layout:** flat. `frontend-web/`, `backend/`, `frontend-ios/`, `packages/*`, three suite placeholders. **No `apps/*` prefix.**
- **iOS folder:** `frontend-ios/` (mirrors `frontend-web/`).
- **Domains:** `app.offside.ai` (web) + `crm-api.offside.ai` (Django) + `platform.offside.ai` (marketing).
- **Transactional email:** Resend.
- **Brand:** OffsideAI Design System v1.0 + production CSS at `OffsideLabs-AI/offsidelabs-ai-web/assets/css/tailwind.css` (adopted verbatim into `packages/ui/src/styles/tokens.css`). Tan/Ink/Bone palette; light-first; Styrene A → Söhne → Inter / Roboto / JetBrains Mono.
- **MVP scope:** AMBITIOUS. Every Round 1–3 feature shipped across 16 milestones. No de-scoping by default.
- **Agent autonomy:** default-suggest, opt-in autonomous per action type. HITL via in-app + email + iOS push.

## Outstanding non-blocking decisions (PRD §9, PLAN §14.1)

- Full logo SVG (favicon already used; full wordmark needed by M3 web shell).
- Per-product secondary hues (proposals in PLAN §10 — clay/wheat/umber/deep-tan).
- Crunch's letter ("X" proposed for X-axis spreadsheet metaphor; unconfirmed).
- Stripe / billing — post-MVP per POST-1.
- APNs key — needed by M6 (iOS shell).
- DO App Platform sizes — needed at first deploy (post-M1).

## Watch-outs

- **Brand book's `#B8916F` fails WCAG (2.54:1 on Bone).** Production CSS uses `#7A5F44`. **Don't "correct" back.**
- **Custom durable workflow layer is a real engineering risk.** Mitigations:
  - Idempotency keys `(run_id, step_id, attempt)` on every side effect.
  - Chaos-test worker kills mid-run early in M7.
  - Run-inspector tooling visible from M7, not delayed.
  - **Hatchet** is the explicit fallback if M9 reveals the layer's complexity is growing past plan.
- **Styrene A is paid (Commercial Type license).** Default ships with Söhne→Inter fallback. Drop woff2 files into `frontend-web/public/fonts/` to activate; the production CSS already lists Styrene A first in the stack.
- **Gmail Pub/Sub setup** requires GCP project + Pub/Sub topic + verified domain. Plan ~1 day of unplanned setup before M10.
- **iOS App Store review timeline** is NOT in the 83-day estimate. Add 2–4 weeks for review/feedback cycles.
- **Type-chain weakness without Drizzle/tRPC.** Mitigation: OpenAPI codegen runs on every PR; CI fails on schema drift. Don't let this slip.
- **AI cost guardrails.** Lead scoring + enrichment + embedding pipelines run on every record write. Per-workspace daily token budgets land in M11; provider fallback (Claude → OpenAI/Gemini) is in `packages/ai`. **Don't ship AI features without these guardrails wired up.**
- **HITL trust.** The autonomous-then-approve UX in M13 has the highest UX-design risk in the plan.

## SaucyCart reuse boundary

Located at `../radianceskincare-app/saucycart-com-backend-django/`. **Reference only — no code copy.**

| Pattern | Reuse? |
|---|---|
| Custom email-based User | ✓ pattern; we re-implement under allauth |
| Multi-tenancy (Tenant / Membership / Middleware) | ✓ pattern; we adapt to Workspace / Membership |
| `admin_crm` signal-based denormalization | ✓ pattern |
| DigitalOcean Spaces storage | ✓ default for media |
| Procfile + gunicorn + DO App Platform | ✓ exact deployment posture |
| Djoser + SimpleJWT | ✗ replaced with allauth + dj-rest-auth |
| Django Ninja | ✗ replaced with DRF |
| Their domain (services / bookings / providers) | ✗ irrelevant to CRM |
| Lack of Celery / pgvector / AI SDKs / Docker / CI | ✗ all added fresh |

## User decision style (working notes)

(Detailed in agent memory; abbreviated here.)

- Picks **ambitious over conservative** every time. "Recommended" labels are context, not nudges.
- Pastes **large brand/spec content** when they want it adopted wholesale (the OffsideAI Design System v1.0 paste landed mid-Round-7 and overrode Round 5's dark-first/violet/Inter answers).
- Pivots major architectural decisions mid-stream. When this happens, **update PLAN.md thoroughly** before more code lands.
- Says "pause" deliberately when they actually want to inspect or commit. Treat literal pause as a literal pause.

## Resume points

M0 is fully scaffolded. **Next milestone is M1 (backend foundation).**

To start M1 from a cold context:
1. `cd backend/ && pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt` — install Python deps locally if not using docker.
2. **Add `apps.users`** Django app (custom email-based User extending `AbstractUser`); add to `LOCAL_APPS` in `settings/base.py`; uncomment `AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"`.
3. **Wire allauth + dj-rest-auth registration/login URLs** under `/api/auth/` in `offside_crm/urls.py`.
4. **Configure Resend SMTP** for email verification + password reset templates.
5. **Replace the `tools/openapi/codegen.mjs` placeholder** with real `openapi-typescript` invocation pointing at `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/`.
6. **First test:** `POST /api/auth/registration/` returns 201, follow-up `POST /api/auth/login/` returns JWT pair, `GET /api/auth/user/` with bearer returns the user.
7. **Celery smoke test:** `from offside_crm.celery import ping; ping.delay()` from a Django shell returns a task id; worker logs the result.

Open `§14.1` items remain defer-able. The first ones that bite during M1 are: APNs key (defer to M6), DO App Platform spec (defer to first deploy).

## Revision log
